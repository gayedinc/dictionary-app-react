## Project Overview

**Dictionary App** is a modern, user-friendly React application where users can view a word's definitions, pronunciation, synonyms, and usage examples.

This app is designed to make the vocabulary learning process more **interactive**, **customizable**, and **practical**.

## Key Features

### API Integration
- Word data is fetched dynamically in real time using the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).

### Light/Dark Theme Support
- Users can switch between light and dark modes.
- Theme preference is stored in `localStorage` for persistence.

### Font Selection
- Users can choose from three fonts: Sans Serif, Serif, and Monospace.

### Click on Synonym to View Its Meaning
- Clicking on any listed synonym fetches the data for that word from the API and displays its information.

### Return to Homepage
- Clicking the dictionary icon takes the user back to the homepage without refreshing the page.

### Error Handling
- If the searched word is not found, an informative error screen is shown.
- If a user submits an empty search, a warning is displayed.

### Custom "Word Not Found" Screen

- When the searched word is not returned by the API, instead of displaying a blank page, the app shows a custom **"No Definitions Found"** screen.
- This screen provides both visual and textual feedback and encourages the user to try another search.

> **Message content:**  
> *Sorry pal, we couldn't find definitions for the word you were looking for. You can try the search again at later time or head to the web instead.*

### Pronunciation Playback
- If available, users can click the audio icon to listen to the word's correct pronunciation.

## Why React?

I previously built a similar application using Vanilla JavaScript. However, with React:

- The code structure became more **modular**.
- State management became easier with `useState` and `useEffect`.
- Component-based architecture improved **reusability and readability**.
- Thanks to Virtual DOM, the app performed **faster**.
